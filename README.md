# Tumblr Video Thumbnails

View video thumbnails in your Tumblr dashboard. Developed by the fine folks at [Rocketboom R&D](http://dev.rocketboom.com).


## About

In today's age, we don't judge books by their covers. We judge them by their thumbnails. We also judge videos, e-books, software, and people the same way. Engaging an audience demands engaging them visually, no matter the medium. Some of our peers in the online video community recently noted that Tumblr allows the display of thumbnails for YouTube embeds on their dashboard, but other popular video sites, such as Vimeo and Blip.tv, are currently left out from showcasing their user videos with a thumbnail image.

[Rocketboom R&D](http://dev.rocketboom.com), the development unit of the [Rocketboom network](http://rocketboom.com), has created a simple solution: a browser add-on that allows Tumblr users to see any video's known thumbnail in their Tumblr dashboard. There's no platform favoritism; this enables nearly every other common video platform the ability for thumbnail display. The add-on was created using [Magma](http://mag.ma), our own video aggregation service, to do thumbnail lookups for numerous video platforms with our simple API methods. The results? Uniformity for Tumblr users and creative support for content creators.
